🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

(Answer) I would say I managed to get myself 3/4 of the way there. The pulling of the API data went well. But i would say it was from that point that my knowledge broke down. This assignment yet again, was another steep learning curve for me, and has exposed my weaknesses and lack of clarity in some areas.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

(Answer) The biggest turning point in this project for me was once I'd reached the point of translating the json data into readable javascript data. My knowledge set broke down here. I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to pull all the data from the fetched readableData in a single loop function, and also create buttons to go with it. I need to brush up on my understanding of loop functions. And also how to create buttons with javascript code. My reset button also became a drawn out saga. I knew that the timer intervals were triggered by my if functions (housed within seperate functions for each upgrade button). And I had no global values for me to clearInterval from outside of those functions. Also, despite sucessfully saving my data to local storage, every time I reset the total coins to zero, you will see the counter quickly turning to 0, but then jumping right back to where it was previously. Couldn't get this figured out. But my guess is it's something to do with all the extra code I've created by failing to keep a single loop function for all.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission.

(Answer) The best thing about this assignment is I felt I was really pushed to my limits in exposing my weaknesses. From spending hours and hours, trying to understand what function was firing when, and why things weren't working the way they should. I now find myself fully aware of the areas I need to brush up on. I would love to have a little time going over this assignment, so I can see where I went wrong, and also to understand how to pass values from one scope to another. I find the passing of a argument from one function to a callback function in another scope a little confusing. I need some clarity on what the () are for and how to implement them.

So all in all, I am dissapointed I couldn't crack this egg completely. But I appreciate the fact my brain has evolved a little more, some things seem clearer to me, whereas I also know the areas that I need to polish up on.
